// Guardian: the auth screens wear the family chrome and the canonical card.
//
// Why it exists: the 2026-08-02 audit found the sign-in flow was the most
// drifted surface in the ecosystem, and the worst case was invisible to every
// existing check — nexolinks' auth pages rendered no header, no footer and no
// theme toggle at all, so a person could switch theme on a 404 but not on the
// login page they actually use. Four different cards, four different headings,
// one tool with no visible heading whatsoever.
//
// Copy into tests/Feature/Nexo/ and adjust the two constants:
//
//   AUTH_ROUTES  — the auth route NAMES this tool actually registers. Routes
//                  that do not exist are skipped, not failed: nexoshort has no
//                  password reset, nexotools no email verification.
//   FOCUSED_AUTH — false for the majority pattern (full nexo-header + footer
//                  around the card). true ONLY for nexoid, whose auth flow
//                  deliberately drops the header and the app-switcher (you are
//                  signing in TO the identity provider; the switcher would
//                  invite you to leave). In that mode the header is not
//                  required, but the canonical theme and locale controls are:
//                  dropping the header must not cost a person their theme.
//
// The card marker is what tells "migrated" from "not yet": until the tool's
// auth views render x-nexo-auth-card, the chrome assertions skip with a message
// instead of failing. A guardian that is red on the day it lands teaches
// everyone to ignore it (same pattern as LandingStandardTest).
//
// Pest note: toContain() is variadic — a second argument is another needle, not
// a failure message — so human-readable messages go through toBeTrue().
