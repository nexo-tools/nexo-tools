// Guardian: every transactional mail this tool sends wears the family layout, is
// really translated, goes to the queue, and does not invent its own sender.
//
// Why it exists: the mail is the only surface of the ecosystem the person sees
// outside the product — in their inbox, hours later, next to everything else in
// their life. The 2026-08-02 audit found four tools with hand-written HTML that
// had drifted apart and two still sending Laravel's English markdown wrapper, so
// the same user got three different products from one ecosystem. And nothing
// could see it: no test in any repo rendered a mail.
//
// Copy into tests/Feature/Nexo/ and fill nexoMails(). It is a function and not a
// const because a const cannot hold closures, and a mail needs building: pass a
// closure per mail, returning either a Mailable or [notification, notifiable].
//
// Skip-until-migrated: with nexoMails() empty every test here skips with a
// message. A guardian that is red the day it lands teaches everyone to ignore
// it (same pattern as LandingStandardTest).
//
// Pest note: toContain() is variadic — a second argument is another needle, not
// a failure message — so human-readable messages go through toBeTrue()/toBe().
