// Why it exists: every tool had rate limits and no two agreed. Two of them left
// the login POST with no route throttle whatsoever — the LoginRequest lockout is
// per email+IP, which does nothing against one machine spraying one password
// across a thousand addresses, and that is the attack that actually happens.
//
// Copy into tests/Feature/Nexo/ and list this tool's named limiters.
